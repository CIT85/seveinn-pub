            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>We plan to expand the website with additional features such as interactive tutorials, live puzzles, and AI-based analysis tools. This will make learning chess more interactive and engaging.</p>
            <p>We also aim to explore new technologies like JavaScript-based game boards, advanced CSS animations, and maybe even integrating Python-based chess engines for analysis. Improving the mobile responsiveness and user interface is another important goal for the future.</p>
