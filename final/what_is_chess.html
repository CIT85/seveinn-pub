            <h2>The Basics of Chess</h2>
            <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The goal is to checkmate your opponent’s king — to trap it so it cannot move without being captured.</p>
            <p>Every piece moves differently, and learning how to coordinate them together forms the heart of the game. Players must balance offense and defense, anticipate their opponent’s plans, and think several moves ahead. Although the rules are simple, mastering chess can take years of study and practice, which makes it both challenging and deeply rewarding for players of all skill levels.</p>

            <h2>A Brief History of Chess</h2>
            <p>Chess traces its roots back to India in the 6th century, where it was known as <em>Chaturanga</em>. It spread through Persia and the Islamic world before reaching Europe, where the modern rules began to take shape during the Renaissance period.</p>

            <h2>How Chess Improves the Mind</h2>
