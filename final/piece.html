            <h3>Pawn</h3>

                <img src="../final/img/pawn.png" alt="chess pawn" title="pawn" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption><em>Pawns are the most numerous piece and often define the structure of the game.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Pawns move forward one square, but on their first move they can move two squares. They capture diagonally, one square at a time. Pawns cannot move backward. They are often used to control the center and open lines for stronger pieces. A pawn that reaches the opposite side can be promoted into any other piece, usually a queen.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Fun fact: Pawns are often called the soul of chess!</summary>
                <p>Strengths: Can promote to any piece, great for controlling the board and opening lines.</p>
                <p>Weaknesses: Weak individually, limited range, and vulnerable when isolated.</p>
            </details>
        </article>

        <!-- Rook -->
        <article id="rook">
            <h3>Rook</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../final/img/rook.png" alt="chess rook" title="rook" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption><em>Rooks are powerful long-range pieces that dominate files and ranks.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The rook moves horizontally or vertically across any number of unblocked squares. It is especially useful in the endgame for controlling open files and supporting pawn promotion. Rooks also participate in castling with the king.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Fun fact: Rooks are sometimes called castles because of their shape!</summary>
                <p>Strengths: Long-range control, excellent in open positions, very strong in endgames.</p>
                <p>Weaknesses: Cannot jump over pieces, needs open files to be most effective.</p>
            </details>

        <!-- Knight -->
        <article id="knight">
            <h3>Knight</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../final/img/knight.png" alt="chess knight" title="knight" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption><em>The knight  s L-shaped movement makes it unique and tactical.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The knight moves in an “L” shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular. Knights can jump over other pieces. They are strongest in closed positions where pawns block long-range pieces. Knights are particularly effective for forking multiple pieces simultaneously.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Fun fact: The knight is the only piece that can jump over others!</summary>
                <p>Strengths: Can reach unexpected squares, great for tactics and forks, excellent in closed positions.</p>
                <p>Weaknesses: Limited range, takes multiple moves to cross the board.</p>
            </details>

        <!-- Bishop -->
        <article id="bishop">
            <h3>Bishop</h3>

                <img src="../final/img/bishop.png" alt="chess bishop" title="bishop" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption><em>Bishops move diagonally and stay on the same color square throughout the game.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Bishops move diagonally across any number of squares. Each bishop is restricted to one color. Bishops are powerful in open positions and in pairs can control long diagonals. They are particularly effective when pawns do not block the board.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Fun fact: Bishops are sometimes called fianchettoed when positioned on the second rank behind a pawn for long diagonal control!</summary>
                <p>Strengths: Long-range diagonal control, strong in open positions, excellent with pair coordination.</p>
                <p>Weaknesses: Limited to one color, blocked by pawns in closed positions.</p>

        <!-- Queen -->
        <article id="queen">
            <h3>Queen</h3>

                <img src="../final/img/queen.png" alt="chess queen" title="queen" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption><em>The queen combines the powers of rook and bishop, making it the most versatile piece.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The queen can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It is extremely powerful for both attack and defense. In the opening, it is often developed carefully; in the middle game, it coordinates with other pieces for strong attacks. In the endgame, it is crucial for checkmating the opponent’s king.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Fun fact: The queen was originally a counselor in historical chess variants and became the most powerful piece in modern chess!</summary>
                <p>Strengths: Versatile, strong for attack and defense, excellent in combination tactics.</p>
                <p>Weaknesses: High value, must be protected, can be targeted by lesser pieces.</p>
            </details>
        </article>

        <!-- King -->
        <article id="king">
            <h3>King</h3>

                <img src="../final/img/king.png" alt="chess king" title="king" width="150" height="150" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption><em>The king is the most important piece; losing it means losing the game.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The king moves one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The king is crucial in endgames, often participating in pawn promotion and supporting other pieces. Castling is a special move that moves the king two squares toward a rook while moving the rook to the opposite side, improving safety and development.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Fun fact: Castling is the only move in chess where a player moves two pieces at once!</summary>
                <p>Strengths: Can castle, supports endgame strategy, can aid pawn promotion.</p>
                <p>Weaknesses: Very limited movement, vulnerable if not protected.</p>
