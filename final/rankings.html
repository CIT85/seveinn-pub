            <h2>Understanding Chess Elo Ratings</h2>
            <p>
                The Elo rating system measures a player's skill level. As you improve at chess—learning openings, tactics,
                strategy, and endgames—your rating increases. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the major ranking stages,
                along with practical suggestions to help you move to the next level.
